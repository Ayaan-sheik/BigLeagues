<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a landing page for a startup called InsureInfra.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
1.  Create a landing page using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
2.  The UI/UX design and content should be an exact replication of the provided JSX code snippet. Mockup images should be used where actual images are indicated.
3.  The main priority is getting the UI functional.
4.  Implement a simple email capture form that stores the email in a MongoDB database.
5.  Remove the code mockup from the Developer section.
6.  Remove the Differentiation section entirely.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A functional Next.js application featuring a single landing page. The page is styled with Tailwind CSS and its content is based on the user's provided JSX. A backend API endpoint is set up to capture leads into a MongoDB database. The UI has been recently modified to remove two sections as per the user's request.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent addressed the user's request to remove two sections from the landing page: the code mockup block within the Developer section and the entire Differentiation section.
*   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
*   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Verified via screenshot tool)
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: NA
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending or in-progress issues.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   **(P0) Add Functionality to CTA Buttons**: The landing page contains several buttons (Request Access, Start Integration, Contact Sales). Currently, they are static. The next logical step is to make them functional, likely by connecting them to an email capture modal or form. The existing  endpoint can be used for this.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Landing Page Creation**: A full landing page was created at  based on the user-provided JSX.
- **Backend API Setup**: A generic, RESTful API handler was created at  to interact with MongoDB collections based on URL paths.
- **Lead Capture Feature**:
    - An API endpoint  was established to save email leads to the  collection in MongoDB.
    - A corresponding  endpoint was created to list captured leads.
- **API and E2E Testing**:
    - The API was tested successfully using .
    - The  was used to perform an end-to-end test of the landing page UI and the lead capture API.
- **UI Refinements (User Request)**:
    - Removed the developer code mockup block from .
    - Removed the Differentiation section from .
    - The final state of the UI was verified via a screenshot.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Architecture**: A single-page application with a generic, dynamic backend API that maps URL segments to database collections.

**key DB schema**
-   **leads**: 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the UI for the main landing page. It was created and later modified to remove sections as per user request.
-   : A critical file containing the generic backend logic that handles all API requests and interacts with MongoDB.
-   : A utility file created to manage and reuse the MongoDB database connection.
-   : The root layout for the Next.js application, created at the start.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The generic API handler at  maps URL paths directly to MongoDB collection names. While this allows for rapid development, it is not secure or scalable. It is recommended to create specific, explicit API routes (e.g., ) for better security, validation, and maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Creates a new lead entry. Expects a JSON body like .
-   : Retrieves a list of all existing leads.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The backend is built around a single, dynamic catch-all API route: . This route interprets the URL path as the MongoDB collection name to perform CRUD operations on. For example, a request to  will target the  collection. Be aware of this pattern when adding or modifying backend functionality.

**documents created in this job**
None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  User provided the initial JSX for the landing page. (Completed)
2.  User urged the agent to start. (Handled)
3.  User confirmed project requirements: use Next.js, prioritize UI, and add a MongoDB-backed email capture form. (Completed)
4.  User requested the removal of the mockup code block in the Developer section. (Completed)
5.  User requested the removal of the Differentiation section. (Completed)

All user messages have been addressed.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working**: The Next.js application, landing page UI, and lead capture API are all functional.

**3rd Party Integrations**
None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES. The testing agent was invoked to validate the initial build of the landing page and the API endpoints.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None. Testing was performed via the  which runs ephemeral tests.
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
No credentials are required for testing.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent successfully built the UI as requested, which includes multiple call-to-action buttons (, , , etc.). However, the functionality for these buttons was not part of the initial request and thus was not implemented. A logical next step would be to connect these buttons to the lead capture functionality that has already been built.</analysis>
